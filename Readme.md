# WinFnord

## Description
A Windows WinForms implementation of Steve Jackson Games' Fnorder. WinFnord hides away in your system tray to display messages from the Illuminati on your desktop.

Some more information about Fnorder as well as a compiled copy of the complete WinFnord application (as well as solutions in other languages and runtimes) can be found at the [Legacy Fnorders](http://www.sjgames.com/misc/fnord.html) page of the Steve Jackson Games website.

## Requirements
This was originally written in July 2007 with VisualStudio 2005 and .NET 2.0. I _assume_ that it will compile under recent versions of VS and the .NET runtime. I have not tested this.

This project is just the WinForms application itself. To produce a working copy of WinFnord at this time, you would need to also grab the [Fnorder project](https://github.com/Williams-Christopher/fnorder) and compile it. The Fnorder project produces a .DLL that is responsible for generating the random Fnord messages used by this application.

## Legalish stuff
I do not hold or claim any copyrights to the Fnorder produced by Steve Jackson Games. I do not work for them or contract with them. Do with this particular project what you like knowing that I offer you no warranties or gurantees of any kind.
